 MATLAB functions to tune the PID values of a control system using the "Ziegler-Nichols" , "Cohen-Coon" and  "Tyreus-Luyben" methods.

1- the "Zieglerâ€“Nichols" method: This method starts by zeroing the integral and differential gains and then raising the proportional gain until the system is unstable.
2-The "Tyreus-Luyben Method": This method is an extension of the Ziegler-Nichols method, and it takes into account the process deadtime and the process gain.
3-The "Cohen-Coon Method": This method is an extension of the Ziegler-Nichols method, and it allows for more accurate tuning of the PID values by taking into account the process deadtime and the process gain.
